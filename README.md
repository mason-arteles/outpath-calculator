# Welcome

This is the work-in-progress calculator for Outpath: First Survival, written entirely in Python.

## Requirements
This calculator uses features introduced in Python 3.10, so you must have a matching version of Python installed in order to run this source code (the primary way which will be intended for running the code).

## Features
Somewhat natural language structure for the prompts (limited to English because I'm a single unilingual person)
Premade formulas found by digging through game code
