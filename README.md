# Welcome

This is the work-in-progress repository for all assistive tools

## Calculator
The Outpath calculator uses features introduced in Python 3.11, so you must have a matching version of Python installed in order to run this source code (the primary way which will be intended for running the code).

### Features
* Somewhat natural language structure for the prompts (limited to English because I'm a single unilingual person)
* Premade formulas found by digging through game code

## Save File Managers

Offer a simplified way to deal with managing multiple save files through Batch scripts. No additional programs required, but will only run on Windows computers.
May port to Bash at a later date.

### Features
* Remembers the last file saved
* Simple interface
* Can be run directly or called through command prompt
